SDK Manager Plugin
==================

SDK missing? API level not downloaded? Support library out-of-date?

These are all typical problems which you shouldn't have to deal with. This is especially painful
when you have multiple developers on a project or a CI machine that you have to keep up-to-date.

This Gradle plugin will manage these SDK dependencies for you automatically.

Supported functionality:

 * `local.properties` will be created if missing. The `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable will be
   used if present. Otherwise `~/.android-sdk` will be used.
 * The platform-specific SDK will be downloaded if missing.
 * The build tools and platform tools will be downloaded if missing.
 * Compilation API declared in `compileSdkVersion` will be downloaded if missing.
 * If any dependencies are declared on support libraries, the support repository will be downloaded
   if missing. If the revision of the support repository does not contain the version declared it
   will be updated.
 * If any dependencies are declared on Google Play Services, the Google repository will be
   downloaded if missing. If the revision of the Google repository does not contain the version
   declared it will be updated.
 * If an emulator is specified, it will be downloaded if missing. If the emulator revision is less
   than the available revision, it will be updated.

Usage
-----

The simplest way to get this plugin is to download the project and publishing it on your local/compagny maven repo.
The version released at maven central is not up to date.
Use the maven publish plugin in build.gradle to custoomize the publish repository.

Apply the plugin in your `build.gradle` *before* the regular 'android' plugin:
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.12.+'
    classpath 'plugin current group id and version'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'android-sdk-manager'
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

// optionally including an emulator
sdkManager {
  emulatorVersion 'android-19'
  emulatorArchitecture 'armeabi-v7a' // optional, defaults to arm
}
```

On an initial run, the output will look something like this:
```
$ ./gradlew clean assemble
Android SDK not found. Downloading...
SDK extracted at '/Users/jw/.android-sdk'. Writing to local.properties.
Build tools 20.0.0 missing. Downloading...
Compilation API android-19 missing. Downloading...
Support library repository missing. Downloading...
Google Play Services repository missing. Downloading...
Emulator version not installed or outdated. Downloading...

(normal execution output)
```
Your output likely will be different depending on the varying factors listed above. Subsequent runs
will omit this output and proceed directly to normal execution.

How long does this plugin add to the build lifecycle? It currently takes about 100ms on average to
check all of the above conditions. This cost is only paid when Gradle is setting up the model for
the project. If you use the Gradle daemon or use Android Studio this only happens once.
